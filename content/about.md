This is a website made from hugo web framework. The theme is [*Hugo-Ficurinia*](https://gitlab.com/gabmus/hugo-ficurinia).
It is highly customizable, and the instructions to customize are quite clear. Although there is a copyright logo at the bottom that can't be removed from editing config files, you can easily remove it by editing footer.html in the layout section of the theme.
